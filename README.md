On hold until the Hugo themes situation is a lot clearer. Themes are a bit of a mess with Hugo and, from my experiences so far, things like overriding a theme using the layout process does not work as per the documentation. Would help a lot if Hugo had some built-in themes that worked exactly as the documentation says they are supposed to work.
