description: An experiment to build a constraint workbench.
---

I've had an [itch to build a constraint workbench tool for a very long time](https://techteapot.com/strange-case-of-the-missing-application/). Constraint Workbench is my attempt to build a prototype of how I think it should work. The good news is that I think I succeeded. The bad news is that I would need an awful lot more time to build an prototype version of the tool than I actually have.

The project has gone as far as I can take it for now. The sources are [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/digitalbricklayer/workbench).
