description: HotSpot SDK is a software development kit for talking to the Sensatronics range of environment monitors.

The Hotspot SDK was originally written to interface with Sensatronics ModelF, E4, E16 and EM1 devices. As we are no longer working with Sensatronics, we are no longer working upon, nor supporting the SDK.

The [Hotspot SDK source code](https://github.com/openxtra/hotspot-sdk) is hosted on GitHub. You are welcome to fork.
