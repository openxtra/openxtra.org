TimeTag is an open source time series database implemented from the ground up for Windows PowerShell. For an explanation as to why TimeTag failed, please read (Lessons learnt from the failure of TimeTag)[http://www.openxtra.co.uk/blog/lessons-learnt-from-the-failure-of-timetag/].

The source code is now hosted on the [TimeTag  repo](https://github.com/openxtra/TimeTag)B. Please feel free to fork.
