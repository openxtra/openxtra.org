OPENXTRA Basics was a free software product produced by OPENXTRA Limited all the way back in 2003. It comprised a number of open source tools of use to the systems administrator or network manager.

The package included network mapping, network monitoring and packet capture tools. It was all packaged together in a single installer with a cute Windows based GUI called OPENXTRA Commander.

It was quickly decided that having all of the tools in a single package didn't really make a lot of sense. Packaging all of the tools into a single package was also difficult because the different tools had different dependencies on WinPCap for instance. So, later in 2003, it was decided to split the packages out into their own packages. And so NTop-XTRA, Ethereal-XTRA and the rest were born.
