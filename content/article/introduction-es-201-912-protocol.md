ES 201 912 is the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) approved standard that allows the sending and receiving of Short Message Service (SMS) messages on <acronym title="Public Switched Telephone Network">PSTN</acronym>/<acronym title="Integrated Services Digital Network">ISDN</acronym> networks.

## Protocol Type 1

Protocol Type 1 allows for a standard message size of 160 characters. Multiple messages may be combined. Protocol Type 1 is compliant with <acronym title="Global System for Mobile Communications">GSM</acronym> <acronym title="Short Message Service">SMS</acronym> services and can be used with mobile devices.

This protocol, sometimes with minor variations, is used in the UK, Germany, France and other countries.

## Protocol Type 2

Protocol Type 2 is a new design. It allows for messages up to 640 characters. Protocol Type 2 is designed primarily for residential fixed networks.

Spain and Italy are the only countries yet to implement the Type 2 protocol consequently implementations of the Type 2 protocol are very scarce on the ground.

## Hardware requirements

Hardware for both protocol types is almost identical. The differences between the two protocols are found mainly in the higher protocol layers.

Data is transmitted in a traditional voice-band call, using 1200 Baud <acronym title="Frequency Shift Key">FSK</acronym> modulation.

Any terminal hardware must be capable of sending and receiving 1200 Baud <acronym title="Frequency Shift Key">FSK</acronym> according to <acronym title="European Telecommunications Standards Institute">ETSI</acronym> standard for off hook data transmission.
